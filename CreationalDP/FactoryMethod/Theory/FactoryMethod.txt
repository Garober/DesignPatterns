Factory method

Is a creation design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

Problem 

Imagine you have a logistic management application.
The first version of it can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your application lives in Truck Class.

After a while, you app becomes pretty popular and receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies 
to incorporate sea logistic into the app.

At present your code is couple to the truck class. 
Adding Ship class to the app would require making changes to the entire code base.
Same would happen if in the future your decide to add another type of transportation.

Solution

The factor method pattern suggest that you replace direct object construction calls (using new operator) with calls 
to a special factory method.
The object still created via the new operator, but it's being called from within the factory method.
Objects return by the factory method are often called Products.

Limitation 

Subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class interface.
Also , the factory method in the base class have its return type declared as this interface
